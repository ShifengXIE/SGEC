### Subgraph Gaussian Embedding Contrast for Self-Supervised Representation Learning
This repository contains the implementation of the Subgraph Gaussian Embedding Contrast method for self-supervised node representation learning.

### Getting Started
Training with Random Hyperparameter Search
To start training the model with random hyperparameter search, run the following command:
```bash
python train.py
```
### Training with Specific Hyperparameters
If you prefer to specify certain hyperparameters, run:
```bash
python singleTrain.py 
```
